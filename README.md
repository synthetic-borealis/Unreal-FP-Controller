# Simple first person controller with smooth crouching & an object grabber
This project contains a simple first person controller with smooth crouching and an object grabber for Unreal Engine 4. Other things included in this character controller are jumping and running (crouch jumping is also possible).
I'm posting this in a public repository in hopes that it can be of use for people who want to learn how to write a first person controller in Unreal and how smooth crouching can be achieved.
